Postdoctoral Fellow 

Matthew joined the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in April 2023 as a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Carolina Population Center. His research, in collaboration with Justin Lessler (UNC) and Lindsay Keegan (University of Utah), focuses on using simulation models to understand biases in key epidemic parameters—such as hospitalization and mortality rates—during infectious disease outbreak detection, particularly with subcritical pathogens. He is also planning to collaborate with the newly established Atlantic Coast Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics and Analytics (ACCIDDA), which includes local public health and other universities, to enhance public health’s capacity in infectious disease modeling and analytics. 

Matthew earned his PhD in Interdisciplinary Research with a focus on infectious disease modeling from Washington State University. His doctoral work provided valuable insights into pathogen transmission dynamics by structuring mechanistic models based on varying levels of population interaction. His prior experience includes eight years as an epidemiologist at a state health department, which continues to shape his research goals in supporting public health efforts against disease outbreaks. 

Outside of work, Matthew enjoys quality time with his daughter and wife, taking family trips, exploring the outdoors, and playing the guitar.
