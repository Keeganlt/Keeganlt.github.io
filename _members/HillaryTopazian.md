Prior to coming to Utah, I was a post-doctoral research associate in malaria epidemiology at Imperial College London. I used individual-based stochastic and deterministic models to test new and existing interventions for malaria control and elimination, and geospatial models to study the effects of human movement. I completed my PhD in Epidemiology with the Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Ecology Lab at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and my Master’s in Epidemiology from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

I have spent time living abroad in Kenya and Malawi, working with the U.S. National Cancer Institute’s Center for Global Health, national Ministries of Health, and other academic partners on HIV, sickle cell disease, Burkitt’s lymphoma, esophageal cancer, cervical cancer, and the RTS,S and R21 malaria vaccines. Currently, I serve as an epidemiology consultant for the Pan African Academy of Christian Surgeons (PAACS) and as a member of the African Esophageal Cancer Consortium (AfrECC) and the Applied Malaria Modeling Network (AMMnet).
